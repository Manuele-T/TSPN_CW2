# Food Hub Web Application

## Overview

Food Hub is a website designed to connect food donators and food pantries. It allows growers to list available food, pantry managers to visualize and reserve those items, and admins to oversee and facilitate the entire process.

## Features

- **Growers**: Post available food items to the Food Hub's inventory. 
- **Pantry Managers**: Browse and reserved listed food items. Upon collection, they can remove the items from the inventory to maintain an up-to-date list.
- **Repo Managers**: Oversee the repository of food items, with the ability to remove items if needed.
- **Admins**: Perform user account management, establish pantry manager profiles, and maintain overall functionality of pantries. Admins also manage communications by handling messages sent within the platform.

## Registration and Access

- **New Grower Registration**: Users can register a new grower profile via the registration page. The profile will remain pending until validated by an administrator.
- **Admin Validation**: Administrators can review new grower registrations and allow them to interact with the website
